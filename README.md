## Kneel Diamonds _plus_  

This code base follows the Book4 examples for building a simple example of a form with three radio button-driven choices for ( temporarily ) creating a custom ring order.  

BUT, there is a problem with the code, as created in Book4. Some have pointed out that it allows you to click the order button and save the selected options even if not all the options have been chosen.

I have added a couple of extra features that demonstrate one path to a solution to that problem. 

Reading other people's code is a vital skill, especially as a junior dev, so if you are curious, and have a little time to spare, read the code and see if you can wrap your head around what's going on. Any of the istructors would be very happy to talk it out with you and/or answer any questions you have!
